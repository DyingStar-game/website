### What game engine do you use?

- Currently, we use the GODOT engine. It's easily accessible, open-source, and documented. If we ever encounter technological constraints, we can modify this engine.

### Do you use AI?

- **No, we forbid it**. We want to have human-like and original designs. AI also poses legal copyright issues that we don't want to deal with.

### How can I participate in the project and where to start?

- You can join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/K4a2mwwBAM) to interact with contributors and leads from each team. Tasks or training may be provided. You can also visit the [contribution](/fr/contribute) page.

### Can we play the game now?

- The game is in development, it is not yet playable, it will take some time for that. However, we have regular player tests to test the technologies, the content, it is announced on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/K4a2mwwBAM) and in the news.
