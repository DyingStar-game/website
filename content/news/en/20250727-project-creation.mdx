## StarDeception

This Sunday, July 27th, I created the **StarDeception** project.

Faced with StarCitizen's bugs and the engineered gameplay that clearly doesn't want to happen, I decided to stop waiting and create my game.

It'll be completely crappy, but at least I'll have control.

I made a super quick test video:

It all started on [Hugo Lisoir's](https://www.youtube.com/@hugolisoiryoutube) Discord server.

A few project features:

* Making an immersive space MMO
* Making it open source, using the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) engine
* â€‹â€‹Game name: **StarDeception**
* No instances, everyone in the same unique universe
* Very few piew piew (weapons)

Well, apparently other crazy people are joining me, I don't know what's going on :D

## Dynamic server meshing

First step, coding the tech!

I'm going to code a first implementation of dynamic server meshing, first test in a few days: **August 1st**
