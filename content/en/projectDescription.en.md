## The Project

We, gamers, dreamers, and space explorers, are joining forces to create something unique:
**the first space simulation game, created by the community, for the community.**

No studio in the world can realize such an ambitious vision without massive funding.
And that's precisely why we're not a studio.
We're a collective of enthusiasts, united by a common dream and the desire to build it together.

A free universe.
A transparent universe.
A universe built on passion, talent, and collaboration.

Our goal: to create, together, the ultimate space game, an open, living, and evolving world, built collectively on the principles of open source, participatory democracy, and artistic integrity.
