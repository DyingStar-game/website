# LDSN 001

## Introduction

This news item presents what's happened on the project over the past 7 days, as it's not easy to keep track of everything üòÑ

This first one won't be complete at all (like, no names of the people working on the elements), and I apologize for that, but in the next ones (the next one or the one after), it will be more complete because we'll have the department heads in place.

## Wiki

The wiki is up and running and is starting to fill out.

## Narrative

The narrative team is making progress and has defined a number of things. Several areas need to be improved in the coming days.

## Gameplay

Several gameplay elements have received a lot of ideas, particularly mining and resource transport.

## Gameplay: Exploration of Unknown Planetary Systems

Firestones presented his planetary system generation ‚ù§Ô∏è
They will be generated server-side, so no data mining is possible, haha, we see you \o/

He also wrote the gameplay for exploring these distant systems, which you can discover here: [discord message](https://discord.com/channels/1399325839665004554/1404482920655093812/1404482920655093812)

## Planet Tech

There are currently two planet tech prototypes, with dynamic LODs...
This will allow us to see which one is best suited to our ambitions.

Tests were also conducted in the game engine; we can manage several hundred parsecs on the map with the double float ^\_^

## Game

Several integrations:

- Restructuring of the game file tree
- New character (the old one was buggy)
- Server-side player management instead of client-side
- Global chat (inter-server), F12 key, emojis work in it üòÑ
- Replacement of the test map with a 5km planet + ship + station
- Addition of 50cm and 4m crates, managed server-side

## Persistence

Object persistence is in progress. A graph-based database has been selected, but is being challenged by the map size and therefore the double float coordinates.

The code is progressing on this part.

## Audio

Work on the audio is also progressing, with prototyping and testing.

## Dynamic Server Meshing

It's currently being recoded, with the REST APIs being moved to MQTT (encapsulated in a web service), which is faster and more efficient.
Optimizations are also starting to be implemented.

## Votes

The DA vote is complete; we're using the Satisfactory game as a reference.

## Art

We've received the first concept art of the Sandbox dwellings!
