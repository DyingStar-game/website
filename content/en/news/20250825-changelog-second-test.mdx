# Changelog

Here is the changelog for the version to be tested tonight (as a reminder, it's at 8:30 PM):

- Moved player management to the server side
- File reorganization
- Fixed the player camera
- Fixed the player rotation
- Added 50cm and 4m boxes (spawn with the **E** and **R** keys)
- Added a global chat, using MQTT. Display with **F12** and **ALT+T** to type in it
- Added a ship
- Added object persistence in the dgraph database
- Added game localization (translation)
- Added error messages (currently only used when disconnecting from the server)
- Reworked the dynamic meshing server, switching from HTTP to MQTT protocol
- Added inter-server replication of boxes and ships (only when spawning and only on already active servers)
- Changed the player UI:
- Displayed coordinates of the area managed by the server
- Added a label above the player with the name of the server the player is on
- Fixed labels (number of servers, number of players, etc.)
- Changed the scene, two 5km planets (one gray and one orange) + two stations
- Integrated FMOD audio server, but disabled for the moment (several issues identified)

# Play test number 2

Here is what that will need to be tested.

## Report issues

Make a video or write a text about the problem encountered, and if possible, how to reproduce it.

## Server meshing dynamic

We'll let you test it, switch from one server to another, what problems you encountered, what works.

**WARNING**: The following issues are already known:

- Black screen lasting less than a second when switching servers
- Problems when switching servers too slowly (visual glitches for a few seconds and then getting stuck on one server)
- When a server splits in two, the second server doesn't retrieve crates and ships from the first server (code not yet stable).

## Global Chat

There is a global chat, accessible via F12. You can write, emojis work. Write as many messages as you can and see how it reacts.
To write, press ALT+T.

## Crate Spawn (Cross-Server View)

You can spawn small crates (50cm) with the R key, large crates (4m) with the E key. Test them on planets, in space, and between servers.
It seems there's a limit of around 2,000 crates spawned, with latency per server... we'd love some feedback on that ðŸ˜‰

## Persistence

We have crate and ship persistence.

We tried restarting the servers last night and loading the thousands of crates into the database, but it took a very long time and consumed resources. We'll see what happens after this test.

## Other

If you see anything else that's not great or doesn't work, please report it too ðŸ˜‰

Thanks everyone, and see you later at 8:30 PM!
