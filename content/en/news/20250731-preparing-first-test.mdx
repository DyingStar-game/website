## Preparing for the first test

### Hello everyone, I'm here to give you some news before the test scheduled for tomorrow evening!

### Internal Tools and Servers

We've developed some really great internal tools.
Here are a few screenshots (with a bonus for the client side).
Some tools are already available in the open source code repository, and the rest will arrive in a few days!

#### Game Server Manager

A Game Server Manager that allows you to deploy and manage servers on a Linux machine! The script configures everything automatically.

### Star Deception Servers

A web application that allows us to monitor the data returned by the servers.
