# Godot 4.5!

Hear ye! Hear ye!

Godot builds for Windows, macOS, and Linux are available with the correct build options. Builds are now automatically compiled by GitHub CI (the export files aren't ready yet, but there's no rush).

You'll find them here: https://github.com/DyingStar-game/godotandaddons/releases/tag/4.5-stable

The DyingStar project (godot) isn't yet in 4.5 (main branch) but will be in a few hours (merge of the `feature/HorizonServer` branch into the `main` branch, which is currently under code review (= code verification by another developer)).
